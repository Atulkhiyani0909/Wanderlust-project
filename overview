**Technologies Used**
=====================

### Frontend
* EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine
* CSS for styling
* HTML for structuring
* JavaScript for client-side scripting
* Font Awesome for icons

### Backend
* Node.js as the runtime environment
* Express.js as the web framework
* MongoDB as the NoSQL database
* Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library
* Passport.js for authentication
* Dotenv for environment variable management
* Multer for handling multipart/form-data requests (image uploads)

### Image Upload
* Multer for parsing multipart/form-data requests
* Cloudinary for image storage and management (optional)

###Deployment
now for the deployment we are using the MongoAtlas for making our data avaliable to the online 
MongoAtlas
username - atulkhiyani
password - Gj5Q2iVr0fAQzOTp
DB link - mongodb+srv://atulkhiyani:<db_password>@cluster0.ot7u1.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

### Validation
* Joi for input validation


### Middlewares
* method-override middleware for overriding HTTP methods
* connect-flash middleware for flash messaging
* express-session middleware for session management
* passport.initialize() and passport.session() middleware for authentication
* ejsMate middleware for EJS templating engine
* dotenv middleware for environment variable management

### User Tracking
* Cookies: We utilized cookies to store and manage user data, enabling efficient tracking and personalized experiences.
* Sessions: In conjunction with cookies, we employed sessions to maintain user state and ensure seamless interactions throughout the application.

### Locals
* res.locals: We utilized res.locals to make certain variables accessible throughout the application, enabling efficient data sharing and management across different routes and templates.



###Error handling
* Custom Error Class: We implemented a custom error class to handle and manage errors in a more structured and efficient way.
* WrapAsync: We utilized the WrapAsync function to handle asynchronous errors and ensure that our application remains stable and error-free.


**Project Overview**
This project utilizes a full-stack approach, leveraging Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to create a robust and scalable application, with EJS templating and CSS styling for a dynamic frontend, and Multer for efficient image upload handling.
